# Welcome to My Terminal

Welcome to my new portfolio site! I've always been fascinated by terminal interfaces and wanted to create something that showcases both my technical skills and provides a unique user experience.

## Why a Terminal Interface?

Terminal interfaces are:
- **Efficient**: Direct command-based navigation
- **Nostalgic**: Appeals to developers and tech enthusiasts  
- **Interactive**: Engaging way to explore content
- **Memorable**: Stands out from typical portfolio sites

## Getting Started

Try these commands to explore:
- `help` - See all available commands
- `about` - Learn more about me
- `projects` - View my projects
- `blog` - Read my latest posts

## What's Coming

I'm planning to add more interactive features, including:
- Enhanced content search
- Project demos
- Interactive tutorials
- And much more!

Thanks for visiting, and enjoy exploring!
