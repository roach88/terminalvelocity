# Svelte Performance Optimization Tips

Svelte is already incredibly fast, but there are always ways to squeeze out even better performance.

## Bundle Size Optimization

Keep your bundles lean:

### Tree Shaking
- Import only what you need
- Use ES modules consistently
- Avoid default exports when possible

### Dynamic Imports
```javascript
const { HeavyComponent } = await import('./HeavyComponent.svelte');
```

## Runtime Performance

### Reactive Statements
- Use `$:` sparingly and efficiently
- Avoid complex computations in reactive blocks
- Consider using derived stores for complex logic

### Component Updates
- Use `key` blocks for list updates
- Implement custom equality checks when needed
- Leverage Svelte's built-in optimizations

## Memory Management

### Store Cleanup
- Unsubscribe from stores in `onDestroy`
- Use auto-subscribing `$` syntax when possible
- Clear intervals and timeouts

### Event Listeners
```javascript
onMount(() => {
  const cleanup = addEventListener('scroll', handleScroll);
  return cleanup;
});
```

## Development Tools

- Use Svelte DevTools
- Profile with browser dev tools
- Measure bundle sizes regularly

Remember: premature optimization is the root of all evil. Profile first, optimize second!
